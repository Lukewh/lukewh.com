I've become increasingly interested in Table Top RPGs in the last year. I've played a few games with randoms on the internet, and in person, but I've not had the experience I want. Through these games I realised that the game isn't important, it's the people you play with. With this in mind I've decided to take things into my own hands and run a game for some willing friends - some with experience of playing TTRPGs, some with no experience. Based on the interests of the group the game is going to be focused more on role play and solving a mystery with little to no combat.

I searched high and low for a simple game system to use, and there are loads, but something irked me about each of them so I decided to create my own... As you do.

The current iteration is available: [here](/1d6).
