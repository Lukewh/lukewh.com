title: WIP - 1d6 System
description: |
 A simple 1d6 TTRPG System for short campaigns or single scenarios.
tags: TTRPG
---

I've become increasingly interested in Table Top RPGs in the last year. I've played a few games with randoms on the internet, and in person, but I've not had the experience I want. Through these games I realised that the game isn't important, it's the people you play with. With this in mind I've decided to take things into my own hands and run a game for some willing friends - some with experience of playing TTRPGs, some with no experience. Based on the interests of the group the game is going to be focused more on role play and solving a mystery with little to no combat.

I searched high and low for a simple game system to use, and there are loads, but something irked me about each of them so I decided to create my own... As you do.

**This is a WIP - TODO**
- [ ] Combat
	- [ ] Chaining
	      If a 6 is rolled during damage dealing or defence the player can roll again, adding the second number to the first.
- [ ] Character Sheet

# Basics
This system prioritises simple rules and maximum role playing through skill checks. Characters do not have levels therefore there is no difficulty scaling involved which suits this system to shorter campaigns or scenarios. While Combat is possible, it is rudimentary, purely in place for those times it's unavoidable.

When a player wants to perform an actions they will inform the Game Master (GM). The GM will decide the Difficulty of a check: Very Easy (2-), Easy (3), Average (4), Hard (5), Very Hard (6+). The player then roles 1d6 to check against the Difficulty. If the number rolled is equal to or higher than the Difficulty the check is a success, if the number rolled is lower than the Difficulty the check is a failure. The meaning of a success or failure is left to the GM to decide.

| Dice Roll | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Difficulty| E | E | e | a | h | H |

E - very easy, e = easy, a = average, h = hard, H = very hard
# Bonuses and Penalties
Bonuses and penalties can be applied to a roll, the most significant are based on a characters training in certain skills. Both PCs and NPCs should have training in skills so as to make interactions more realistic. The other available bonus is through an Bonus Token (BT). Bonus Tokens are given to PCs by the GM for exceptional roleplaying or generally improving the game in some way. Each character starts with 1BT and BTs are tied to the character, not the player. 1BT adds a +1 modifier to a roll or a -1 modifier to an opponent's roll.
# Skills
Skills are used to help or hinder a Difficulty check roll. If a character attempts a check with a skill they have no training in they receive a DM-1 (Dice Modifier -1) to their check. By default all skills are untrained, see character creation for more information.
The 4 levels of training are:

| Level | DM |
|---|---|
| Untrained | -1 |
| Trained | 0 |
| Advanced | +1 |
| Expert | +2 |

Using this system a character trained in a skill to the Expert level will never fail easy skill checks as the minimum they can achieve is a 3.

# Character Creation
Characters can be as detailed as the player wants but the required information about a character are their name, their skills, and a quirk.

It's recommended to have a rough back story for your character, it's up to you whether you share this with the other players or keep it a secret - this will largely depend on the relationship your character has with the other characters. If the characters just met they probably wouldn't share that their childhood village was burned to the ground and they were the sole survivor.
Having a back story helps you decide on the skills your character will take, their quirk and possibly even their name.
## Names
Naming things is hard, naming people is harder - if in doubt keep it simple and familiar. Your character may officially be called "Janet", but that doesn't mean the other PCs or NPCs won't create a nickname for her that she prefers to use.
## Skills
As mentioned before it's important to choose skills that fit with your characters personality and back story. It's also wise to choose at least one skill that is relevant to the settings and campaign. For example if the game you are playing is set in a cyberpunk world, Magic probably isn't that useful. If there are any skills that should not be picked, your GM should inform you before character creation.

When creating your character you have a pool of 7 points to assign to skills. You are free to assign these points in any way you'd like. For example you could assign 3 points to Intimidation to become an expert, 3 points to Melee to become an expert and 1 point to Performance to become trained. Alternatively you could assign 1 point to 7 skills, being trained in all 7 of those skills.
## Quirk
A quirk is a feature about a character that could be a positive, or negative trait depending on the situation. For example if a character has the "easily distracted" quirk they may miss vital information when someone is talking to them, this would be a negative. However during a routine exploration the same character may see something shiny twinkling out of the corner of their eye and find some hidden treasure, this would be a positive.

A characters quirk is up to the player to decide, it should be something that fits with the characters backstory or overall personality, for example the "easily distracted" quirk would not naturally fit into a character who's main skills require high focus.
## Bonus Token
When you've created your character they are automatically assigned 1BT.
# Checks
When a player would like to perform an action they must inform the GM of their intent referencing any appropriate bonuses or penalties that may apply. The GM will then confirm the bonuses or penalties and ask the player to roll for the check. It is up to the GM whether they inform a player of the check's Difficulty. Sometimes the GM will keep the Difficulty secret to increase tension, other times they may state the Difficulty before the player roles to increase tension.
